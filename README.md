# Cryptos

I am looking to build simple tools to allow users to interact with Cryptos in an easy way.

Currently the project has:
1. A script to find the price of a certain crypto.
2. A slackbot built on top of the price script to build "Price Bot" so users can interact with the bot and find prices in slack.
